# Churn-Prediction-Using-ANN

Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are a type of machine learning model inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. ANNs are composed of interconnected nodes, called neurons or nodes, organized into layers. Each node receives input signals, processes them using an activation function, and produces an output signal. The output signals from one layer are passed as input to the next layer, creating a hierarchical structure.

Artificial Neural Network primarily consists of three layers:

<h3>Input Layer:</h3>


As the name suggests, it accepts inputs in several different formats provided by the programmer.

<h3>Hidden Layer:</h3>

The hidden layer presents in-between input and output layers. It performs all the calculations to find hidden features and patterns.

<h3>Output Layer:</h3>

The input goes through a series of transformations using the hidden layer, which finally results in output that is conveyed using this layer.

The artificial neural network takes input and computes the weighted sum of the inputs and includes a bias. This computation is represented in the form of a transfer function.

What is Artificial Neural Network
It determines weighted total is passed as an input to an activation function to produce the output. Activation functions choose whether a node should fire or not. Only those who are fired make it to the output layer. There are distinctive activation functions available that can be applied upon the sort of task we are performing.
ANNs learn from data through a process called training. During training, the network adjusts the weights associated with each connection between nodes in order to optimize the model's performance. This process involves feeding labeled data into the network, comparing the predicted outputs with the actual outputs, and using optimization algorithms to update the weights accordingly.

ANNs are versatile and can be used for a wide range of tasks, such as image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and playing games. They are also capable of deep learning, which involves multiple hidden layers, allowing them to learn complex patterns and representations from large amounts of data.

One key advantage of ANNs is their ability to learn from unstructured data, making them suitable for tasks such as image and speech recognition. However, ANNs can be computationally intensive and require large amounts of data for training. Additionally, overfitting, where the model becomes too specialized to the training data and performs poorly on unseen data, can be a challenge in ANN training. Regularization techniques and careful data preprocessing are often used to mitigate this issue.

Overall, ANNs are a powerful class of machine learning models that have found widespread applications in various fields and continue to be an active area of research and development in the field of artificial intelligence.
